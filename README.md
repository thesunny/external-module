# External Module

This package is content copied over from `wysimark-monorepo` which is the `xternal-module` code that is no longer used in Wysimark.

The code inside needs to be wired up again and probably needs a once over as well.

- The `src/external-module` is the original external module code.
- The `pages` is for `Next.js`.
- The `src/crash` was originally from `lib/crash` and tests imported code
- The `src/hello` is the same
- We probably need to create some `public` files of which these are compiled versions as well with `rollup`
